Final evaluation for whoever will come in the future.

Heuristic algorithms is quite an interesting course, unfortunately the lectures are quite boring, although I think that Cordone is an excellent teacher and is always ready to help.

I followed the course with one eye open and the other closed because everything is already written on the excellent slides and he, generally, does not add anything to the contents (I basically studied only on them).

Plus there is an amazing pdf (I refer to the one in english that he published on his site) with a ton of good exercises and a good deal of theory thoroughly explained. From what I learned from others, the theory is not curated by him but the exercises are, so you should keep them in mind (they will come handy).

The exam is not difficult, he isn’t particularly “cruel” when it comes to the correction (also because the evaluation starts with more than 30), beware of the theoretical questions because those aren’t always trivial. As a colleague said, and I agree, I think that he basically cares more that you argument your ideas rather than giving him the straight facts. Of course he does want you to answer correctly but you should also explain what you’re doing.

Also beware of time! 2:30 hours are plenty but sometimes you just have to rush a bit.

Last but not least, how much should I study? I would say that you’d have to study at least two weeks a bit intensely (3 to 4 hours a day). I didn’t keep track but I’d say that I’ve studied for this exam about 3 weeks with a big rush towards the end (last weekend I basically did only this for about 6 to 8 hours a day) and got 26 as a result.
