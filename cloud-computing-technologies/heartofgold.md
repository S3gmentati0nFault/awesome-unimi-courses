I had already taken the theory in 2023 and the lectures were boring as hell, useless as all hell and there was essentially nothing that could be taken from them, both professors are basically machine learning models that turn written text into sounds. There is also a PhD that handles the lab part (if it can be called lab) and basically you just see this guy doing things for hours on end, don't know if it changed with the 2024 edition but it was still unbearable.

All in all the result of the theoretical part -> useless, at the exam is not even asked therefore is all the more useless.

When it comes to the exam it's extremely confusing, little to no information is given and some of the information on the website are blatantly wrong (there was supposed to be, once upon a time, a 2 hrs written test that never saw the light of day because the theory of this course is, again, useless) I was told by people on the group that the presentation would have to last 15 minutes because otherwise I would have had to resort to writing an email to either of the professors to get info.

How is the exam then?

You can either write a paper or a project using cloud technologies, there is some suggestions on the website but they are extremely basic.

The exam itself is a very random 15 - 20 minutes in which you present your project / paper and then they might ask some questions about it (again, no theory needed) and then you go home.

Apparently you have to hand in like a report 2 weeks before the exam date but I handed it in the day of the exam because the last version I sent was incomplete (the draft I sent a week before the exam, but I was not prevented from taking the exam anyway). Don't know if the situation me and the colleagues were was particular or anything but they usually do not listen that much and it might happen that they ask frustrating questions that force you to repeat yourself or to show slides again.

All things considered this exam is pretty useless and don't do it expecting to get great satisfactions out of it, the marks are very high usually and they do not request anything crazy from the students taking the exam.
