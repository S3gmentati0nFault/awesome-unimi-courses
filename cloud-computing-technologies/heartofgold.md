I had already taken the theory in 2023 and the lectures were boring as hell, useless as all hell and there was essentially nothing that could be taken from them, both professors are basically machine learning models that turn written text into sounds. There is also a PhD that handles the lab part (if it can be called lab) and basically you just see this guy doing things for hours on end, don't know if it changed with the 2024 edition but last year was unbearable.

All in all the result of the theoretical part -> useless, at the exam is not even asked therefore is all the more useless.

When it comes to the exam it's extremely confusing, little to no information is given and some of the information on the website are blatantly wrong (there was supposed to be, once upon a time, a 2 hrs written test that never saw the light of day) I was told by people on the group that the presentation would have to last 15 minutes because otherwise I would have had to resort to writing an email to either of the professors to get info that should be already publicly available.

How is the exam then?

You can either write a paper about cloud technologies or develop a project using cloud technologies, there is some suggestions on the website but they are extremely basic.

The exam itself is a very random 15 - 20 minutes in which you present your project / paper and then they might ask some questions about it (again, no theory needed) and then you go home.

Apparently you have to hand in a report 2 weeks before the exam date but I handed it in the day of the exam because the last version I sent was incomplete (the draft I sent a week before the exam, but I was not prevented from taking the exam anyway). Don't know if the situation me and the colleagues were was just unlucky but they did not listen that much to the presentations and ended up asking frustrating questions that (in my case) that force you to repeat yourself or stand up for yourself because they also might "accuse" you of not doing or presenting something when you actually did.

All things considered I would not really recommend this exam, keep in mind that this is the second
year it is held so there is still ample time for improvement, as it currently is I guess it's only a
good training ground for people that want to try and get into a PhD (because it kind of mimics the
presentation of a research project).
