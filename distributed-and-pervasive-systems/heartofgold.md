First of all let’s talk about the lectures, they are really boring, unfortunately, the subject is highly practical and a good deal of time is used to do theoretical things that are not all that interesting. Plus it is not really required to follow to pass the theoretical part.

The lab part is interesting enough, it took me back to the real lab sessions we used to have in bachelor, when the professor asked you to do something and everyone was on his own looking for a solution that, in most cases, would be found once home with the documentation or a video open.

Nonetheless I would say that the lab was pretty cool and fairly useful to understand some of the concepts necessary to deal with the project (more about it in a minute).

Both professors seem really nice, didn’t talk all that much with Bettini but his assistant (Arrota) is always available in the case of need, plus he’s very empathetic and amiable with students. I had a problem with the project back in July and he made himself available for a call and he helped me debug the program.

Let’s talk about the exam.

The exam is split into two parts: Theory and practice.

The theory can be disposed of pretty quickly if the “preappello” is done, in case of “preappello” the exam date will be earlier than usual (in May) but it will be a written test consisting of a bunch of closed answer questions and two open questions. If you follow the lectures I think that the proposed questions will be on par (if not easier) than the questions proposed during the course.

If someone is not able to attend the “preappello” will have to do the oral theory exam with professor Bettini, it should be one on one and (from what I heard) it is more challenging than the written exam.

The project can get a bit messy. I had a bit of experience with Java, but I still had my fair share of problems due to not knowing the language well. I wanted to present in July but I had synchronization problems coming and going, thus I decided to hand the project over in September.

The additional request was hard but not impossible and the project overall required me about a month of work (you could say, give or take, about 180 - 200 hours) the result was really convincing and had just a handful of very small bugs that could be resolved in a couple of hours (if I actually found them before the day of the exam).

I got 28 just because I did not handle correctly the synchronization inside the Admin Server, which is fair.

Now, a couple of words of advice.

1. Do the written exam, it will make your life a heck of a lot easier.

2. Go to the introductory laboratory lessons if possible, if you have any doubts regarding the project, professor Arrota is going to be there, ready to help you.

3. Do not be scared of the oral discussion about the project, you are going to be with professor Arrota and you will be able to discuss your choices without having the barrel of a rifle pressed on your forehead.

I’m glad I have done this course (and more glad that I was able to finish it), if you have any
